              The Grip Foundation, an NGO working for child education believes that education is both the means as well as the end to a better life: the means because it empowers an individual to earn his/her livelihood and the end because it increases one's awareness on a range of issues - from healthcare to appropriate social behaviour to understanding one's rights - and in the process help him/her evolve as a better citizen.
              <br> 
              The Grip Foundation extended its thematic areas of intervention by supporting family health, livelihood, and women empowerment. Children, their families and the community become the target group for The Grip Foundation's activities as child education cannot be done in isolation and nothing else but education for children can bring long lasting change in the society.
